/* (Unpacking Characters from an Integer) Using the right-shift operator, the bitwise
AND operator and a mask, write function unpackCharacters that takes the unsigned
int from Exercise 10.12 and unpacks it into four characters. To unpack characters
from a four-byte unsigned int , combine the unsigned int with the mask 4278190080
( 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 ) and right shift the result 8 bits. Assign
the resulting value to a char variable. Then combine the unsigned int with the mask
16711680 ( 00000000 11111111 00000000 00000000 ). Assign the result to another char
variable. Continue this process with the masks 65280 and 255 . The program should
print the unsigned int in bits before itâ€™s unpacked, then print the characters in
bits to confirm that they were unpacked correctly. */
