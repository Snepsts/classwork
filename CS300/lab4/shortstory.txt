Once upon a time, aeons ago, on a world orbiting a
distant sun very much unlike our own an intelligence we
could not begin to comprehend had a thought we could not
even conceive of, let alone understand, which would, in the

us.  "We are so large against the sky, so small against the
stars ..." according to Leonard Cohen.  Verily, a big frog
in a very small pond.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the lone ranger
mistaking his trust indian companion Tonto ....  Lone
ranger jokes are a step down from elephant jokes.


Well it's time to go now.  If you are good, next time
I'll tell you the shaggy dog story that has the punch line
"You can't sent a Knight out on a dog like this."
