/*
Define a class called Odometer that will be used to track fuel and mileage for
an automobile.

The class should have instance variables to track the miles driven and the fuel
efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon.

Include a mutator method to reset the odometer to zero miles,

a mutator method to set the fuel efficiency,

a mutator method that accepts miles driven for a trip and adds it to the
odometerâ€™s total,

and an accessor method that returns the number of gallons of gasoline that the
vehicle has consumed since the odometer was last reset.

Use your class with a test program that creates several trips with different
fuel efficiencies. You should decide which variables should be public, if any.

Requirements:
1. Use the data of 200, 500, & 700 miles as the trips driven to get the values
in related to total miles driven, fuel efficiency, and gallons of gasoline
consumed since the odometer was last reset.

2. Upload your program code and the screen shot of the running results.
