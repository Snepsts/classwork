3. Create a class named Movie that can be used with your video rental business.
The Movie class should track the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)
rating (e.g., Rated G, PG-13, R), ID Number, and movie title with appropriate
accessor and mutator methods. Also create an equals() method that overrides
Object â€™s equals() method, where two movies are equal if their ID number
is identical. Next, create three additional classes named Action , Comedy , and
Drama that are derived from Movie . Finally, create an overridden method named
calcLateFees that takes as input the number of days a movie is late and returns
the late fee for that movie. The default late fee is $2/day. Action movies have a late
fee of $3/day, comedies are $2.50/day, and dramas are $2/day. Test your classes
from a main method.
