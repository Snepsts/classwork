# README

This is my classwork, so it's mostly just a backup

### What is this repository for?

My homework. I use it to share my answers with friends who cannot understand questions, or for my friends to correct my misunderstanding of questions. It's also nice to be able to git clone my entire homework repo on a new computer, seeing as I'll have gone through 3 laptops and lord knows how many VMs and desktop Linux installs.
